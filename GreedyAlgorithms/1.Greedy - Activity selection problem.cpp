/*
Let us consider the Activity Selection problem as our first example of Greedy algorithms.
 Following is the problem statement.
 You are given n activities with their start and finish times.
 Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person
 can only work on a single activity at a time.
 Example:

 Example 1 : Consider the following 3 activities sorted by
by finish time.
     start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
     finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};
A person can perform at most two activities. The
maximum set of activities that can be executed
is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and
finish[] ]

Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities
sorted by by finish time.
     start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
     finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
A person can perform at most four activities. The
maximum set of activities that can be executed
is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and
finish[] ]
*/

/*
Rule to follow in this algo
   1.sort the pair according to the finish time.
   2.print the first .
   3.from next onwards , pring the pair whose start time in greater or equal
   to the finish time to recent printed pair.

   THAT's It!!!!
